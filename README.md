## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I have learned how to use SASS to build this Product card. 
However i am having difficulty in dividing the sass into different files.
i have tried to do import on variables only. 
But when i tried to make a separate media query file and used import it didn't work well and the design . 

So i was wondering if anyone could give me some tips on writing proper sass and how to properly import files. 



### Useful resources
